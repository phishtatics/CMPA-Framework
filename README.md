Threat actors employ sophisticated phishing strategies, such as Phishing-as-a-Service models, artificial intelligence,
reconnaissance, and even insiders. Threat Intelligence teams must develop robust strategies to handle such scenarios.
The **CMPA™ (Counterintelligence Methodology for Phishing Attacks** is a Open Framework that empowers Cyber Threat Intelligence teams to map, analyze, and holistically understand their threat ecosystems, with a particular focus on phishing campaigns — one of the main vectors of cyber threats.
CMPA™ supports the mapping of phishing campaign infrastructures, enabling the correlation of threat patterns and the continuous enrichment of the intelligence base with new attacks, modus operandi, and social engineering techniques.

# Objective

With **CMPA™**, it is possible to collect and analyze the following information:

* Behavioral patterns of targeted attacks
* Correlation of characteristics within **Threat Actors’ infrastructures**
* Generation of **IOCs** (Indicators of Compromise) with a higher level of depth
* Correlation of IOCs across multiple campaigns to identify the **Threat Actors’ original infrastructure**
* Holistic visibility of the threat ecosystem **intrinsic to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1660**
* Continuous **feedback and enrichment** of the intelligence base with **new phishing attack strategies**

# key results
* Real-time visibility into the current phishing threat ecosystem for your company
* Understand which areas are most likely to receive phishing campaigns
* Have indexes of phishing attack and social engineering strategies employed
* Visibility of the types of malware that are identified in campaigns
* Possibility for the Threat Intelligence team to create reports for teams to mitigate identified weaknesses in the threat ecosystem
